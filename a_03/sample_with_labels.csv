"I want you to do me a favor tonight. When you're outside, look up at the sky. See the stars and the moon. Take it all in, and realize that in the entire universe, with every possibility, every challenge, you are still here. That has to count for something. Just think about it. Any planet, with infinite possibilities of life, and you ended up here. You're made up of the very elements forged from stars, all coming together to make you who you are. Every rock and piece of debris pushed everything into perfect place, just so you could be here, so you could have room to move and live in. When you were born, it wasn't just you floating along at your own leisurely pace. You competed with millions upon millions of other cells, all fighting to do what you accomplished. You've made it through every setback, every sickness, every problem and battle and struggle. I will always bet on you making it, because I know you can. You've made it through 100% of everything life has thrown at you, so I know that you can make it through anything that comes your way, and those are odds I'm willing to bet on",1
